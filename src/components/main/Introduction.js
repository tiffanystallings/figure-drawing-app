                        Hello there! This little tool is inspired by all of the great work already being done 
                        over at <StyledLink target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://line-of-action.com">
                        Line-Of-Action</StyledLink>. I love their image cyling format, but wanted something I could use with
                        reference images stored locally on my device. I hope you find it as useful as I do!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not all functionality is working yet, so stay tuned for more!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If this application is helpful to you and you'd like to support enhancements (such as more reliable hosting), 
                        small tips are always appreciated! That said, I plan to continue making little enhancements regardless 
                        (since I use this too), so do feel free to just sit back and enjoy. ðŸ˜Š
